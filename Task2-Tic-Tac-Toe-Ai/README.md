# Emoji Tic-Tac-Toe AI

This project is an interactive, web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game built entirely with Python and the Streamlit framework. It features an unbeatable AI opponent that uses the Minimax algorithm to calculate the perfect move every turn.

The core of this application is a classic game theory algorithm and state management within Streamlit, creating a challenging and engaging game without the need for a large, pre-trained model.

## üöÄ Key Features

This Tic-Tac-Toe game is packed with features that demonstrate game theory logic and a clean user interface:

- **Unbeatable AI:** Play against an AI that uses the Minimax algorithm, making it impossible to defeat.
- **Interactive Game Board:** A clean 3x3 grid with clickable buttons to place your moves.
- **Stateful Gameplay:** The application tracks the board state, the current player's turn, and the game's outcome (win, draw, or ongoing).
- **Clear UI and Game Status:**
  - Players are represented by fun emojis (üòä for Human, ü§ñ for AI).
  - A status message clearly announces the winner or if the game is a draw.
  - A "New Game" button allows you to reset the board and play again instantly.
- **Educational AI Explanation:** Includes a built-in expander that explains how the Minimax algorithm works, offering insight into the AI's logic.
