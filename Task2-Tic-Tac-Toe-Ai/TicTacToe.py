    This AI uses the **Minimax algorithm**, a classic logic-based approach for two-player games. It does not use a pretrained model like GPT.

    **Here‚Äôs how it works:**
    1.  **Looks Ahead:** It explores every possible future move down to the end of the game.
    2.  **Assigns Scores:** It gives a score to each final outcome (+10 for an AI win, -10 for a human win, 0 for a draw).
    3.  **Assumes You're Smart:** It assumes you will always make the best possible move to beat it.
    4.  **Finds the Optimal Path:** It chooses the move that guarantees the best possible score for itself, no matter what you do.

    Because Tic-Tac-Toe is a "solved game," Minimax can calculate a provably perfect move every time, making it **unbeatable**.
