# Task 1: Intellibot - A Rule-Based Chatbot

This project is a sophisticated, rule-based chatbot named "Intellibot," built entirely with Python and the Streamlit framework. It is designed to be an interactive and engaging AI assistant that can handle a variety of tasks, remember context within a session, and even play games.

The core of this chatbot relies on regular expressions and a state management system to provide dynamic and context-aware responses without the need for a large language model.
